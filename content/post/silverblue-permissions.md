> error: stat of /var/log/boot.log failed: Permission denied

I came across an interesting error, persistent on installations of Fedora Silverblue which were installed in a similar timeframe of each other around February 2023. Anytime I checked affected systems' health with `systemctl status`, I would notice that `logrotate` had failed. While logrotate is useful for systems with long uptimes or high log outputs such as servers, the affected boxes were sporadically used desktops. Nonetheless, this really bothered the perfectionist in me. Here's a log excerpt for the logrotate unit from an affected system:
```console
Starting logrotate.service - Rotate log files...
error: stat of /var/log/boot.log failed: Permission denied
logrotate.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
logrotate.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
Failed to start logrotate.service - Rotate log files.
```

## The Solution
I assumed immediately the file `/var/log/boot.log` had incorrect permissions set at install-time, causing logrotate to fail early after boot. A bit of Google-Fu (as always), however, led me to suspect SELinux was involved. This is where the `restorecon` command comes in handy:
```console
[johannes@clay ~]$ sudo restorecon -r -v /var/log
[sudo] password for johannes: 
Relabeled /var/log/fsck_hfs.log from system_u:object_r:var_t:s0 to system_u:object_r:var_log_t:s0
Relabeled /var/log/boot.log from system_u:object_r:var_t:s0 to system_u:object_r:plymouthd_var_log_t:s0
```

So running this command indeed "fixed" both our suspected boot log as well as another one.[^hfs] After re-starting `logrotate.service`, the error was gone.
[^hfs]: fsck_hfs.log probably is a remnant of the original macOS partition that was wiped during the installation of Silverblue.

## A Word on "Immutability"
Immutable Linux distributions like Fedora Silverblue and NixOS have **many** perks, and I recommend them those that avoid the terminal where possible as well as seasoned enthusiasts. However, discrepencies like this are proof that for the time being, "immutable" doesn't mean 100% untouchable.
