I'm starting the new year in a particularly rough state, although my social and emotional life has never been better. Around this time last year, I blazed through exams and a big software project, met my current partner, and --- after half a year with her --- decided to move together with her, for which we found and renovated a new apartment. To top it off, I had the opportunity to start a part-time job in the IT division of an insurance provider, a major step up to my previous jobs.

Still, I'm haunted by the upcoming exams, which will determine the rest of my career path. In this post, which I was encouraged to write by a friend, I want to elaborate on my past and present situation.

# My Background

Immediately after moving to Germany in the summer of 2016, I think my mental health began to suffer. The house my parents built did not have a room for me, as such I was under pressure to move out. Getting accepted into a German university with a high school diploma instead of the *Abitur[^abi]* or equivalent from other countries (British A-Levels, the French Baccalaur√©at, the International Baccalaureate, etc.) was tedious and nerve-racking.

After a long back-and-forth discussion with the admissions office[^case] I was finally admitted in the major of Electrical Engineering. It was there, in the preliminary mathematics course, that I became nervous. Although I was fortunate to have excellent teachers in highschool, with "advanced" electives such as calculus, many of the notations and solution methods seemed foreign to me. My first semester was overwhelming, and I secretely stopped going to class the second.

I was living alone in a new city. Many of the people I met in the first semester dropped out or switched majors[^dropout]. I was extremely lonely, demotivated, and couldn't admit to friends and family that I was lost. Most of my nights were spent drinking or partying to distract myself from the fact that I didn't know what to do with myself. I think it was at this point that I began dissociating, or something of that kind. I don't remember much of the first four semesters where I lived by myself.

Meanwhile, things were not looking great on my family's side, either. My parents divorced (I can very much understand why), after their own struggle, the majority of my family members moved back to the US.[^family] None have studied under similar circumstances to mine.

I think my mental health hit rock-bottom at this point, and in some ways, I guess I'm lucky I'm still here today.

## Coming to Terms with Myself

It was the spring of 2018 that I received a final warning from the university. My grades were too low, I was about to be kicked out, and realized I had no option but to change the direction of my life. I clearly wasn't interested in electrical engineering. It was then that I went to a consultation appointment with a university councelor. I was thankful that they took the time to try and help me, but I was fairly unsatisfied with the intial advice I was given.

Even though I had long given up in day-to-day student life, I really wasn't keen on officially dropping out, one of the options presented to me. I tried explaining my sitation, that I was keen on actually earning a degree, and that I did spend much of my free time before tinkering with *nix and programming. It was here that a new alternative came to mind:

# Switching majors to Computer Science

I turned in my forms the same week, and fortunately, switching majors was much less of a hassle than enrolling the first time.

The first semesters came and went with mixed feelings. I was *really, really* good in most practical subjects. It felt too good to be true to finally particiape in classes like *Programming I* and *Fundamentals of Operating Systems,* I was ecstatic that I could actually deep-dive into the subjects that I spent so much of my free time with.

There was, however, a downside. Computer Science is math-heavy, and at the TU9[^tu9] universities, fields like theoretical computer science make up a bulk of mandatory subjects. These were the subjects that I didn't immediately understand, that gave me anxiety, that I intrinsically tried to stay away from, despite their (I now admit) importance of a well-rounded CS education. I was convinced I couldn't pass these; but I was determined to try anyhow. Lo and behold, it was a struggle more with myself than the fact that these weren't considered "easy A" classes.

## Managing the Situation

To a lesser or greater extent, I've worked very hard to pass the exams for nearly all mandatory and elective classes while working part time. I'm really looking forward to writing my bachelor's thesis and working full-time: as boring as it may sound, I've realized that I really flourish in office environments, working at a computer all day. I spend the free time that I have coding or doing volunteer tech support, and I am at a point where I can very much monitize those skills.

After eight years of on-again off-again fights with my mental health,[^health] countless sacrifices in fun and free time to manage coursework and employment ... I really just strive for a life of modern normalcy: A job, and a family to come home to after that job.

# The Catch

I've passed all but two courses: analysis and discrete mathematics. These are, on their own, tough subjects, which pretty obviously "weed out" unqualified or lazy undergrads in their first two semesters, and provide solid fundamentals to build upon in later courses.

The irony, of course: I'm practically done with my studies. This is computer science, and there have been plenty other subjects that required fundamental knowledge of calculus, sequences, combinatorics, graph and set theories, et cetera.

I attended most math lectures and tutoring sessions offered by the university (unfortunately, I had to work during some others), but much of what I am learning, I am teaching myself.[^tutor] I feel like I am learning in slow-motion, taking multiple hours just to first understand and then apply a topic which is brushed over in ten minutes during a lecture. The fundamentals just aren't there to hit the ground running, as most other students appear to do --- even the other strugglers I know managed when they applied themselves.

I feel extremely disadvantaged due to working part-time and not having the *Abitur*-level familiarity which is expected. Particularly analysis has been rough: it combines into one subject what many other colleges teach as Calculus I - III. In order to pass I need to be confident with limits, con- and divergence theorems, vector calculus and multi integrals, Lagrange multipliers, unit tangent vectors, et cetera, all of which must be applied within a two-hour exam.

This wouldn't be all that bad, if our study regulations didn't limit us to three attempts per exam[^attempt] before [forceful exmatriculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/b5wqvq/exmatriculation_from_a_german_university_and_then/). My first attempt at analysis was in the summer of 2022, which I prepared for with the help of a private tutor. After failing, I decided to take a break, focus on my other subjects, and re-take the exam after attending all lectures and tutorials a second time.[^offer] I took my best shot, again, in 2023. Despite working late shifts at a movie theatre I made sure to spend the early day attending classes and practicing all material offered. In August, I failed again, just barely below the threshold, which has sent me into the current downward spiral.

I have been preparing for two months, trying to understand and practice all material that I have available to my from the university and other sources on the internet. But should I fail again, in my third attempt, I will have fought the toughest battle of my life so far, for nothing. I'm not quite sure how to deal with that.

[^abi]: the highest of several secondary education qualifications in Germany, typically completed after 12 or 13 years of schooling.

[^family]: I won't get into further details, as this is a public post into which I cannot devulge too much information about other people's lives.

[^case]: I was the first German citizen enrolling with a high school diploma at the university and in a gray zone.

[^dropout]: Many majors are *Zulassungsfrei,* meaning anyone with qualified certificates may enroll regardless of their school grades. As a result, people abandon their current studies due to lack of interest or compulsory exmatriculation after failing to pass exams.

[^tu9]: The alliance of the nine leading technical universities in Germany.

[^tutor]: I had a tutor for linear algebra, which I passed on my first try. Unfortunately, she was not much help with some Analysis Topics.

[^attempt]: After the third exam attempt is failed, an oral examination is offered, allowing a student to "swing by" with the lowest possible grade, should they pass it --- this is something I want to avoid.

[^offer]: While exams are offered every six months, Lectures and tutorials are only offered in one semester of the year. In the case of Analysis, that is only during the summer.

[^health]: As I have learned through my partner and friends, a good part of the problems seem to stem from perhaps abusive members of my family, and once I have the time, I am commited to process these issues with a professional.
