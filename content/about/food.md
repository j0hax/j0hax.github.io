Iâ€™m not sure I have a favorite food ;)

Although I like meat, I tend to eat little of it. Instead I season vegetarian foods well. I love my herbs and chili. Of the finer things in life I also appreciate

- strong cheeses, such as Esrom, Camembert or Parmigiano-Reggiano
- fresh, black coffee
- Scotch, especially the peaty, salty kinds
- red wines such as Primitivo or Dornfelder
