My favorite hot sauces :)

## Marie Sharp's "Green Nopal"

{{< rating score="90" >}}

While not particularly hot, this is easily one of the *tastiest* hot sauces I have tried.

* Well rounded, with notes of garlic and fruit
* Adds a dash of flavor to basically any dish
* Even people who don't care for spicy food may like this one

## El Yucateco "XXXTra Hot Habanero"

{{< rating score="85" >}}

A hot hot sauce, supposedly based on a Mayan recipe.

* Quite hot but still enjoyable, a delight for chili heads
* Probably underrated

## Cholula Original

{{< rating score="65" >}}

Nothing wrong with this sauce; an honest to God "standard" hot sauce, popular for a good reason.

* Medium-low heat
* Not too acidic
* **Available anywhere:** even across regular grocery stores northern Europe. This means it I can consume and share it without paying exorbitant prices for small imports.
