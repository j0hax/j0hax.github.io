>Gentlemen, as some of you know, I've really struggled with my studies over the last few semesters. Most of the exams went accordingly well, but after years of procrastinating or failing, I ended up in the third attempt of Analysis and Discrete Structures, two math subjects.
>
>This semester, I decided to just write these fucking very last compulsory exams that were left to me, come hell or high water. For the first time since I started university, I took two weeks off to prepare (I know, fucking Buxe[^buxe] and all). With the support of some accomplices in the Goethesaal[^goethesaal] and my dear friend, I felt like I was in good company, but I had a hard time knowing if I would pass. Not only was I in my third attempt at two "failed subjects", but as I had already told many people, I simply lacked a lot of prior knowledge and intuition from my Abitur. In addition, changes were made to the study regulations and the topics of the exam were different to what my fellow students had written before me. On top of that, both exams were within two days of each other.

>I spent almost every night between December and today with only a few hours of sleep, simply because I was worried about what to expect when I saw the Stud.IP message that the grades had been published. I was very, very worried about losing everything I've managed to pull together in the last few semesters. Today I got the message. Long story short: I'm throwing two barrels for passing my personal two "final exams" and I'm really looking forward to *completing my studies* soon!
