Aside from my personal project repositories on GitHub, many were the result of university courses or my work as a student assistant.

# Previous University Projects

These are select university projects that I found particularly fun:[^pp]

[^pp]: Please note that some projects were the result of pair-programming or group work.

[^contract]: Unfortunately, this project was signed into sole ownership of the University and client, and as such may not be published by me. I was the sole contributor for the back-end, which provided an API written in Python and stored Data in a CouchDB instance. 

# Projects Completed as a Student Assistant

I am very lucky to have spent three years at the [Institute of Continuum Mechanics](https://www.ikm.uni-hannover.de/en/), where I did IT Work as a _studentische Hilfskraft._ Select Projects were commisioned and subsequently open-sourced:
