I currently have a couple watches in my daily rotation:

# Nomos Tangente
This is my go-to watch. Dressy yet minimalistic enough for "normal" occasions like university classes or travelling. Even though the design is approaching 100 years old, the minimalistic look makes it subtle and compatible with many outfits.

Sometimes I do miss the date complication, though.

# Seiko SNK809
An excellent bang for the buck in the mechanical watch world. I switched out the metal bracelet for a green/yellow NATO strap, giving it an even more rugged, militaristic look.

I primarily use this watch when doing outside work. My only complaint is that the [7S26c](https://calibercorner.com/seiko-caliber-7s26/) movement doesn't support hand-winding, meaning if the watch runs out of power it gets really annoying to constantly readjust the day-date complication.

# Casio F-91W
This one should be self-explanatory. I keep it synced to my workplace's clock.
