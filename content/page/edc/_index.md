> Everyday carry (EDC) or every-day carry is a collection of useful items that are consistently carried on person every day. The main reasons for having EDC are utility (usefulness), self-sufficiency, and preparedness: to help individuals improve simple everyday problem solving, from the mundane (opening packages, minor repairs) to possible emergency situations such as first aid or self-defense etc. Some of the most common EDC items are watches, pens, wallets, car and home key rings, mobile phones, flashlights, multi-tools, tissues, medications, and personal care items.
