I'm starting the new year in a particularly rough state, yet my social and emotional life has never been better. Beginning this time last year, I blazed through exams and a big software project, met my current partner, and --- after half a year with her --- decided to move in with her, for which we found and renovated a new apartment. To top it off, I had the opportunity to start a part-time job in the IT division of an insurance provider, a major step up to my previous jobs.

## Rough Beginnings

Immediately after moving to Germany in the summer of 2016, I think my mental health began to suffer. The house my (now divorced) parents built did not have a room for me, as such I was under pressure to move out. Getting accepted into a German university with a high school diploma instead of the *Abitur[^abi]* or equivalent from other countries (British A-Levels, the French Baccalaur√©at, the International Baccalaureate, etc.) was tedious and nerve-racking.

After a long back-and-forth discussion with the admissions office[^case] I was finally admitted in the major of Electrical Engineering. It was there, in the preliminary mathematics course, that I became nervous. Although I was fortunate to have excellent teachers in highschool, with "advanced" electives such as calculus, many of the notations and solution methods seemed foreign to me. My first semester was overwhelming, and I secretely stopped going to class the second. I was living alone in a new city. Many of the people I met in the first semester dropped out or switched majors[^dropout]. I was extremely lonely, demotivated, and couldn't admit to friends and family that I was lost. Most of my nights were spent drinking or partying to distract myself from the fact that I didn't know what to do with myself. I think it was at this point that I began dissociating or something. I don't remember much of the first four semesters where I lived by myself.

It was the spring of 2018 that I received a final warning from the university. My grades were too low, I was about to be kicked out, and realized I had no option but to change the direction of my life. I clearly wasn't interested in electrical engineering. It was then that I went to a consultation appointment with a university councelor. I was thankful that they took the time to try and help me, but I was fairly unsatisfied with the intial advice I was given, which boiled down to:

1. drop out and enroll at the *Hochschule* (University of Applied Sciences), where the coursework is less theoretical
2. drop out and start an apprenticeship
3. drop out and return the United States.

Even though I had long given up in day-to-day student life, I really wasn't keen on officially dropping out. I tried explaining my sitation, that I was keen on actually earning a degree, and that I did spend much of my free time before tinkering with *nix and programming. It was here that a new alternative came to mind:

4. Switch majors to computer science.

I turned in my forms the same week, and fortunately, switching majors was much less of a hassle than enrolling the first time.

## A New Start

The first semesters came and went with mixed feelings. I was *really, really* good in most practical subjects. It felt too good to be true to finally particiape in classes like *Programming I* and *Fundamentals of Operating Systems,* I was ecstatic that I could actually deep-dive into the subjects that I spent so much of my free time with.

There was, however, a downside. Computer Science is math-heavy, and at the TU9[^tu9] universities, fields like theoretical computer science make up a bulk of mandatory subjects. These were the subjects that I didn't immediately understand, that gave me anxiety, that I intrinsically tried to stay away from, despite their (I now admit) importance of a well-rounded CS education. I was convinced I couldn't pass these; but I was determined to try anyhow. Lo and behold, it was a struggle more with myself than the fact that these weren't considered "easy A" classes.

[^case]: I was the first German citizen enrolling with a high school diploma at the university and in a gray zone.

[^dropout]: Many majors are *Zulassungsfrei,* meaning anyone with qualified certificates may enroll regardless of their school grades. As a result, people abandon their current studies due to lack of interest or compulsory exmatriculation after failing to pass exams.
